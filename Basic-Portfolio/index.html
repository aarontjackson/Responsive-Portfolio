            <!--Paragraph about myself-->
            <p>Greetings all! My full name is Aaron Timothy Jackson. I was born in Clinton, MD and rised nearby in
                Waldorf, MD.
                I graduated from Florida A&M University with a Bachelor's degree in Policy Science and a Master's degree
                in Public Health. After
                graduating I regrettably asipred to go into politics, which <strong>fortunately</strong> did not work in
                my
                favor.</p>
            <p>I decided to put my public health degree to use, and worked as the coordinator for Winston-Salem State
                University's Mobile Health program. This program provided underserving communities with access to free
                health
                services. Eventually, during my tenure I progressed to the program director. Although I loved helping
                people, I felt a bit unfillied and stagnant in my previous position. I decided to take a leap of faith,
                and
                enter the exciting and challenging field of coding.</p>
